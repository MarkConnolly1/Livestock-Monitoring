# LiveStock Monitoring System with Behavioural Analysis

I am currently working on my final year project, where I am applying Computer Vision and training You Only Look Once (YOLO) models to monitor livestock and analyse their behaviour. The objective is to develop a reliable system capable of detecting various behaviors in different environments to assist in better management and care. I am training and evaluating the performance and accuracy of two versions of the YOLO object detection models: YOLOv5 and YOLOv7. This system aims to provide insights into livestock health and behavior, facilitating proactive management and improved welfare practices.
